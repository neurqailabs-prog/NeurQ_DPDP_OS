SIMPLE ICON FIX - GUARANTEED TO WORK
========================================

I've copied the icon file to your DESKTOP for easy access.

========================================
EASY METHOD (2 Minutes)
========================================

1. Look on your DESKTOP
   You should see: "QS-DPDP OS.lnk" shortcut
   You should also see: "QS-DPDP-Icon.ico" file

2. RIGHT-CLICK on "QS-DPDP OS.lnk"

3. Click "Properties"

4. Click "Change Icon" button (at bottom of window)

5. Click "Browse" button

6. In the file browser, you're already on Desktop!
   Just select: "QS-DPDP-Icon.ico"
   (It's right there on your desktop!)

7. Click "Open"

8. Click "OK"

9. Click "OK" again

10. Press F5 on your desktop

DONE! The icon should now appear!

========================================
WHY THIS WORKS
========================================

- Icon file is now on your desktop (easy to find)
- No need to navigate to other folders
- Direct manual application (Windows respects this)
- Desktop refresh clears cache

========================================
ICON FILE LOCATIONS
========================================

On your DESKTOP:
   QS-DPDP-Icon.ico  ← Use this one!

Original location:
   D:\NeurQ_DPDP_Cursor_15012026\QS-DPDP-OS-Icon.ico

Both are the same file - use whichever is easier!

========================================
IF STILL NOT WORKING
========================================

The icon file might need to be in ICO format.
Try this:

1. Open: create-custom-icon.html (in browser)
2. Download the icon
3. Use online converter: https://convertio.co/png-ico/
4. Save as ICO format
5. Apply using steps above
